When you play your game through midnight the game takes a 'snapshot' of the current family and adds it as a new block here. The information includes their current home (Lot Number) and how many family members are present. When you send sims to a community lot and leave other family members at home then only the sims present are counted, not the sims left at home. The information about family members also includes how many female adults, how many male adults, how many female children and how many male children. Adults is young adults, adults and elders. Children is babies, toddlers, children and teens. It does not differentiate between pets and humans, my guess is that's because this existed since base game and since it's not used it was never updated.

It does collect other information, 83 bytes altogether but this is the only stuff I have been able to work out for sure. Invalid blocks (blocks with no Lot information) are very common in neighbourhoods that have just been set up and not played through much, typically in neighbourhoods that have just been downloaded.
