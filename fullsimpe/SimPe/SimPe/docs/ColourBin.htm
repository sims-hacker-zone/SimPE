primary purpose of this tool is to colour bin hair files, it will
colour bin eyebrows and beards equally well. It can perform a couple
of simple things with <A HREF="#Skins">Skin-tones</A> and <A HREF="#Clothing">Outfits</A>
as well.</SPAN></FONT></P>

Before loading a file first select the correct colour bin for it from
the available tabs. Use the &quot;File &rarr; Open&quot; menu or the
context menu to load a package file into the selected tab. Repeat
this process for the other tabs (Brown, Blonde and Red). If you
accidentally load a file into the wrong tab you can move it to
another empty tab from the context menu. You can select which age
groups you wish to keep or remove on each colour tab (<I>things will
only actually be removed if you select that option on the 'Package'
tab</I>). You must pay special attention to the fact that a properly
binned hair should have only one elder (grey) recolour, so you must
choose carefully one elder recolour out of the four available. Hair
for elders is always binned as grey by virtue of age even though it
appears to be in another colour. On most cases you can ignore the
Grey, Custom and Unbinned tabs. Once you are done you can 'Save'
which will overwrite the existing files or 'Save As' which will
create a single new package with all of the parts loaded. If you
create a single file from multiple parts that way it can't be edited
in this tool again as all parts would be loaded into the same colour
bin.</font></P>

tool is of limited use for things other than hair but for skins it
does provide a simple way to alter the</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000" size="4">

an easy way to change the mesh (body-shape) used. This is not so easy
for things other than skins as the new mesh must contain the same
named parts as the old mesh and map the textures the same, but that
is rarely a problem for skins. 'Outfit Type' in 'Other' Tab in

clothing a few simple operations like correcting the Shoe Type and
perhaps extending an Adult outfit to include Young Adult are
available. If you have the Body Shop Organisation Kit (BSOK)
installed or are using Angels and Nurses stuff you can easily set the
body shape for it to be categorised from a drop down list.</SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
