<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Sim<font color="#FF8040">Pe</font></b>'s File Table and 
Preferences Profiles</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Left alone SimPe will load far more into it's File Table 
than Sims2 will ever load, causing SimPe to become slow, cumbersome and 
unstable. Various parts of SimPe will load the File Table in different ways and 
if the File Table is huge that will cause long delays and instability.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the very least you should unselect those parts in the 
Advanced Settings: that are marked as (Unused), the Unused tag is there for your 
information. Even though SimPe 'knows' not to use them it will use them if you 
want it to (<i>and you don't want it to</i>).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Setting up a profile and creating the shortcut for the 
profile may seem a bit daunting at first but once it is done you never have to 
do it for that profile again. Instead of creating a shortcut for your profile, 
you can start SimPe using any saved profile from The Sims 2 EPselector.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once you have SimPe's layout and File Table configured the 
way you like then you should then save it as a profile. When you save a profile 
SimPe saves your preferences then copies them to the profile folder, so next 
time you start SimPe it will use the same settings as that profile. Therefore 
you need the first normal profile to restore your preferences after creating 
other profiles. It is also very easy way to restore SimPe if its layout ever 
gets messed up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">SimPe's profiles were added by it's original authors for 
the purpose keeping SimPe lean for specific tasks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you plan to edit neighbourhoods you don't need SimPe to 
load the 3D resources. You will need it to load the Objects from your highest EP as that contains several NPCs and all of 
the sim memories. You will also need the Wants and perhaps UI from your highest EP. If you expect to use Sim Surgery 
then you may want to keep Base Game's catalog/Skins, catalog/Bins and Sims3D but there is very little else 
you might need. If you intend to edit/view memories you will need the PJSE File 
Table loaded. You may also consider disabling a few plug-ins for some profiles to keep SimPe a bit leaner.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you plan to use Object Workshop then you need the 
opposite, you will need all of the 3D resources from every EP and SP so Object 
Workshop can pull textures and meshes from them. You will need the 
Objects from your highest EP (<i>everything needs that</i>), you will 
also need all of the Stuff Pack\Objects and the Overrides from your highest EP 
(which updates the Stuff Pack\Objects). You can simply configure the 
file table for Object Workshop by 'De-Select All' then just set the 'Include 
Graphics' in the Simple Settings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you are 'modding' op-codes then the File Table is not so 
important as the PJSE components use their own File Table. Keep the Objects 
and Overrides from your highest EP and&nbsp; all of the Stuff Pack\Objects 
but there is very little else the File Table needs in this profile. Setting PJSE 
to load its File Table and GUID Index at start-up is useful for this 
profile.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Sims2 Story Editions:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you want a profile for one of Sims2 Story Editions then 
there is a 'trick' you need to do. SimPe always knows what games you have 
installed even when they are disabled in the File Table and always gives 
priority to Sims2 over the story editions so it can't treat them as the separate 
game that they are.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To get SimPe to never load anything from Sims2 or its 
Expansions you can set it to only load support for your chosen Story Edition in 
'Various / Only Load Support For'. Once set SimPe will 'see' Sims2 and its 
Expansions as not installed. If SimPe finds nothing but a story edition then it 
will treat it properly and fully support it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana">Store Editions:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">EA released two Store Editions both with the same 
executable name, therefore it is impossible for both exist in the App Paths 
registry so neither SimPe or Sims2 can load both. On starting, SimPe will check 
for the newer Store Edition (<i>by checking Store Edition's 'Suppression Exe' 
value in Windows registry</i>), if SimPe 
finds it or the Extra Stuff Pack**&nbsp; it will load 
support for the newer Store Edition, otherwise it will just support the old 
Store Edition.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">**With the newer Store Edition since the old Store Edition 
can't be used, both SimPe and Sims2 can support an extra custom Stuff Pack in the gap 
left by it. For SimPe to load your custom Stuff Pack it must have an executable name of Sims2ECC.exe 
(<i>the executable doesn't need to actually exist except in Windows registry</i>).</p>
